## Dumper: The Profile Generator

The `dumper` module is an integral part of Wordlist Wizard, providing the ability to generate random profiles. Here's how it works:

### How It Works

- **Dataset Loading**: Loads a dataset (either in English or French) to gather names, professions, hobbies, etc.
- **Random Profile Generation**: Creates a profile with randomly selected attributes such as name, date of birth, profession, hobbies, and even pets.
- **Password Generation**: Constructs a password based on the generated profile attributes.

### Sample Output

A generated profile might look like this:

```
PROFIL:
PRENOM: John
NOM: DOE
DATE DE NAISSANCE: 15/07/1985
NOMBRE DE FR√àRES ET S≈íURS: 2
FR√àRES ET S≈íURS:
  - Nom: Jane
    Date de naissance: 12/03/1990
  - Nom: Jack
    Date de naissance: 20/05/1992
PARENTS:
  - Nom: Michael
    Date de naissance: 04/04/1960
  - Nom: Sarah
    Date de naissance: 10/10/1962
M√âTIER: engineer
HOBBY: reading
ANIMAL DE COMPAGNIE: dog
SURNOM DE L'ANIMAL: buddy
```

The `dumper` module not only generates these profiles but also creates a sample password based on them, ensuring it's a fun and informative tool for security testing.
